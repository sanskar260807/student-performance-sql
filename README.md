# 🎓 Student Performance Tracker (SQL Mini Project)

This mini-project is a student performance tracking system built entirely with SQL. It simulates a college database that keeps track of students, the subjects they study, their marks, and analytics like average scores and top performers.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

- `schema.sql` – Creates the database and all necessary tables.
- `insert-data.sql` – Inserts sample data for students, subjects, and marks.
- `queries.sql` – Contains useful queries for practice and reporting.

## 🧱 Tables Used

| Table Name | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `Students` | Stores student personal and academic details |
| `Subjects` | Stores the list of subjects |
| `Marks`    | Stores marks obtained by students in each subject |

---

## 🔍 Sample Queries Included

- Show all students and their marks
- Calculate average marks per student
- Rank students based on total marks
- Find top scorers in each subject
- List students who scored above 90 in any subject

---

## 💡 SQL Concepts Practiced

- Joins (`INNER JOIN`)
- Aggregate Functions (`SUM()`, `AVG()`)
- Grouping (`GROUP BY`)
- Ranking (`RANK() OVER`)
- Subqueries and nested filters
- Database schema design

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Open a SQL environment (e.g., MySQL Workbench, XAMPP phpMyAdmin, VS Code + MySQL extension).
2. Run `schema.sql` to set up the database and tables.
3. Run `insert-data.sql` to add the sample data.
4. Run queries from `queries.sql` to explore and analyze the data.
